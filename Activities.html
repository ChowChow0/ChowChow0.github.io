<h2>Meetings</h2>
<p>Meetings are held twice a week on Wednesdays and Thursdays during activity period. 
Our activity period is a 30 minute period of time in the middle of every school day. 
The purpose of activity period is to give students the opportunity to attend their 
clubs, go in for extra help, and make up work for the classes they missed. For TSA 
specifically, students are given the opportunity to go in twice a week during activity
period, but also after school from around 2:25 p.m. to  4:00 p.m. TSA members are 
required to attend at least one of these meetings each week. During these meetings,
students will work on their events, either with their group or individually.

<h2>Accountability</h2>
<p>To keep track of attendance, there is a sign in sheet that is passed around at the 
beginning of each meeting so students can sign in and keep track of the meetings theyâ€™ve 
attended. In addition, at the beginning of each month, there is a check-in form where 
students must update the teacher on the status of the event and the progress made since 
the previous month. After they are completed, students check in face-to-face with the 
TSA officer who is assigned to their event. During this check-in, officers assess the 
progress each student or team has made in their event and make sure that they know what 
the deadlines and expectations are.

<h2>State Competition</h2>
<p>Our school participates in two competitions. The first one is the State Conference 
which will be held at Delaware Technical Community College on April 1-2 of 2020. The 
competition brings together numerous students with a passion for STEM along with many 
advisors, judges, and chapters from across the state.

<h2>National Competition</h2>
<p>The second competition our chapter participates in is the National Conference which 
will be held at Gaylord Opryland Resort and Convention Center in Nashville, TN from 
June 27-July 1, 2020. Only those who placed 1st, 2nd, or 3rd in the state will be 
eligible to compete in the national competition.
