<td>Students in the Engineering Pathway at our school have been learning about how to determine the places where tension or compression occur in trusses. At first, they calculated the forces applied at each member of the truss, and then later in the process, they worked in groups to develop what they thought would be the best truss while still fitting the constraints created by the class. In the picture is one group breaking their truss while a force probe is calculating the applied force which determines the best truss after being compared to other groups.
