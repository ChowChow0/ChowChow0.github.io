<td>Students in the Biotechnology Pathway have been conducting numerous experiments to learn about cells. In the picture, students are extracting DNA from their cheek cells by using simple household items such as gatorade and dish soap. This is one of the very first labs done in Biotech that is used to introduce students to both lab procedures and the DNA extraction process.</td>

<td>Students in the Engineering Pathway at our school have been learning about how to determine the places where tension or compression occur in trusses. At first, they calculated the forces applied at each member of the truss, and then later in the process, they worked in groups to develop what they thought would be the best truss while still fitting the constraints created by the class. In the picture is one group breaking their truss while a force probe is calculating the applied force which determines the best truss after being compared to other groups.

         <td>Students in the Computer Science Pathway at our school are introduced to all the different fields within computer science, one of these fields being robotics. In the picture, a student has developed and built their own LEGO robot with motors and sensors. The next step for them is to code their robot to complete missions assigned to them which will force them to make use of their robot's sensors and motors.</td>
