<p><h2>What is TSA?</h2>
<p>TSA (Technological Student Association) is a national organization allowing 
opportunities for students from middle schools and high schools to 
not only grow in STEM fields but also to create a lifelong community for these students.
<p>The motto for TSA is “Learning to lead in a technical world”  which allows members of
the organization to learn skills needed in the STEM field and implement them in their 
futures and current problems in society.<p>
<h2>Our Creed</h2>
<p> I believe that technology education holds an important place in my life especially 
in a quickly-evolving technical world. I believe there is a need for the development of 
good attitudes concerning work, tools, materials, experimentation, and processes of industry. 
Guided by my teachers and professionals, I will strive to do my best in making my school, 
community, state, and nation better places in which to live and spread the influence that 
technology has on this generation and will have for generations to come.<p>
