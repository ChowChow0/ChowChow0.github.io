<p>The 2020 design brief asks students to design a website of a fictional electric vehicle manufacturing company. Students were supposed to demonstrate their knowledge of coding by including components such as the vehicles their company sells and the shop in which customers can buy vehicles. Our team decided to use this design brief as a way to increase awareness of the impact of harmful chemicals and other hazardous substances which are damaging the environment. We decided to name our company “Electrx '' to emphasize the power that electric vehicles can have on current vehicle industries. The website provides a way for customers to find general information about Electrx and the industry’s goal as well as the vehicles that the creators have made and specialized to positively impact the environment. Not only that, but the website gives an opportunity for customers to buy the vehicle that they are interested in and schedule a test drive if they aren’t entirely sure if Electrx is the right vehicle for them. Additionally, we were able to add our own ways to encourage the purchase of electric vehicles. For example, we incorporated a page of our website to explain the carbon impact that electric vehicles have. As fossil fuel is quickly reaching its peak since numerous countries around the world are seeking more of it, the Carbon Impact page discusses just how important electric vehicles have on the environment thus as customers purchase the vehicles, they are positively helping the home for themselves and their future generations.
