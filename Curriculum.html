        <center><h3>Our School's STEM Pathways</h3></center>
        <center><p>
Technology has become all the more relevant. Thus, our school offers three STEM pathways in attempts to expose students to the work environment and help them become more familiar. At our school, we have five different pathways that students are able to choose from when entering high school. The pathways are global leadership and business as well as three STEM related pathways: computer science, engineering, and biotechnology.
            <br><br>
The purpose of these pathways are to help students follow their passions and explore their interests in a specific field. With STEM specifically, students can choose from three pathways available: Computer Science, Engineering, and Biotechnology. The Computer Science pathway allows students to experience a wide range of computer science related interests, from coding and website design to robotics. The biotechnology pathway allows students to investigate the effects of technology on health and life sciences as well as participating in experiments to further their knowledge of the sciences. The Engineering pathway allows students to participate in a program called Project Lead The Way. Here, students learn about the different techniques of engineering and how to design their own prototypes to solve everyday problems.
<br><br>
However, students aren't restricted to these STEM related pathways as they have the option of taking either Global Leadership or Business. The Global Leadership Pathway educates students about the meaning of leadership and teaches students on how to collaborate with others in a group. This pathway examines current conflicts and problems all around the world so as to broaden the students persepectives and world views. Finally, the business pathway provides students with an understanding practical business skills. Students work on various elements of business and study all aspects that pertain to business. In this pathway, students have the opportunity to compete in a competition called Business Professionals of America (BPA).
<br><br>
Our school, through these pathways, allow students to experience all aspects of a certain career field so as to prepare them for the real world. The modern world is fast-paced and growing continuously. With vast improvements in technology and new innovations being developed everyday, science and with technology. This will ensure that the future generations will be able to find jobs in a rapidly changing economy.
