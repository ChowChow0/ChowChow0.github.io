		amount that I had to pay, I still received so much from it!! 
		If you want to drive any car that’s beneficial to the environment 
		and has the latest car technology, then Electrx is for you. 
		You won’t realize how important this car is until they are 
		all so out. It feels like I’m driving in the future. Just 
		smarter, faster and more convenient.” </td>

		they denied everything I said. What type of car brand is this! 
		I’ll never buy from them again.” </td>

		great that I’m helping the environment since I haven’t bought gas 
		in 5 years. Charging has become a routine for me and really made 
		me aware of the carbon impact on society.”</td>

		ask about their newest model, but the employee didn’t even answer 
		my questions. But the model was superb. I love the fact that we 
		can charge the car instead of getting gas.”</td>

		have never had any problems, maintenance is so easy, and I
		laugh every time the price of gas increases.  I would recommend these
		cars even if my daughter didn't own the company.”</td>
